# Covid-19_Data_Linear_Regression

This is the final project for CS 540, Spring 2020, UW-Madison.

Linear regression with macro economic metrics and the rate of increase in the number of cases

Note that the reason for conducting linear regression is based on the diminishing return phenomena. Since the development of a country is subject to diminishing return, the metrics would hardly have an impact on a variable that exceeds the impact of x on y for function y = kx, where k is a constant. So based on this assumption, the R2 coefficient reflects how much linear between the independent variable and the label, which reflects the importance of that variable. 

For now, the code is corrected. But the report needs further correction.
